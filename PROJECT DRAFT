Title: DANE AND EMMY'S GAME SHOW QUIZ
Problem statement: Most games are not letting people learn anything. In our game, we give funfacts and lets the user enjoy. 
Project Objectives: Our project aims to create a fun trivia game about our favorite fandoms that people can play in their free time to cure their boredom. We will 
use function blocks to keep the code organized and easy to understand. The game will have questions and a scoring system to make it enjoyable. 
To prevent addiction, we will include a screen-time timer and break reminders. 
Planned Features: Point system, Being able to choose the fandom, Being able to choose the difficulty of the question. 
Planned Inputs and Outputs: The user will input which fandom they want to answer a question of and they will choose a difficult and the 
code will output the question and the user will input the answer and then the code will check the answer and adds a point if answered correct, 
and our code will output if they are correct or wrong and their total amount of points.
Logic Plan: Flowchart is in included in our repository
